Recursive SQL queries for PostgreSQL & Oracle
This repository contains a collection of recursive SQL queries developed for a fictitious courier company. The purpose of these queries is to analyze execution performance under large‑scale data conditions in both PostgreSQL and Oracle.
These recursive queries are designed to simulate real‑world logistics scenarios such as route traversal, package movement, and hierarchical relationships between operational nodes.
The structure of the database used for these tests can be viewed in the following image.
